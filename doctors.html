        <h1>The Role of Doctors</h1>
        <p>Doctors are the backbone of any hospital, playing a critical role not only in patient care but also in the
            overall operation of a healthcare facility. In a hospital management system, their responsibilities extend
            beyond direct treatment to include interacting with digital tools that streamline their workflows. The
            system allows doctors to efficiently manage patient data, including medical histories, test results, and
            prescriptions, all in one platform.

            By utilizing electronic medical records (EMR), doctors can access and update patient information in
            real-time, ensuring that they are always working with the most current data. The system also enables
            seamless communication between departments, ensuring faster response times for consultations or referrals.

            Additionally, features such as appointment scheduling and follow-up tracking help doctors manage their time
            better, reducing administrative burdens and allowing them to focus more on patient care. These digital
            solutions are crucial for improving diagnosis accuracy, patient satisfaction, and overall hospital
            efficiency.

            As healthcare continues to modernize, the integration of doctors into hospital management systems represents
            a major step toward better patient outcomes and streamlined hospital operations.
